# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

  The problem for these projects was that I needed to create a program that loads course data, organizes it using a data structure, sorts the courses, and allows users to search for course details and prerequisites. 

How did you approach the problem? 

  I approached the problem by using different data structures like a vector, hash table, and a binary search tree to store and manage the course data. Figuring out how each structure works helped me decide which one would be the best one for the different tasks. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks? 

  I experienced roadblocks when I had trouble reading the file and handling prerequisites correctly. Debugging with print statements and carefully checking how the data was being stored helped me fix them. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

  Working on this showed me how important it is to pick the right data structure for performance and how organizing code properly makes development smoother. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

  I learned how to better keep my code structured, use comments, and write functions that make the program easier to update and understand.
